## Prompt

> Help me choose a few Harvard Extension courses to build up my team leading skills. I've done some mentoring but now I'm looking at a job where I am tech lead for up to ten people. Some areas where I need work:
> 
> *    team dynamics, handling egos and difficult people
> *    tracking the activities of all team members - some of this is just dumb stuff like keeping a notebook and staying awake in meetings
> *    nudging people in the most productive directions, getting buy-in where needed 
> 
> When making recommendations don't just say "look for a course that covers XYZ", provide specific references to existing courses including web links.

The "Strategy and Results" module includes techniques for tracking team progress through OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)[1].

### Relevance to Your Needs:  
- **Self-Awareness & Influence**: The course begins with assessments like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to help leaders understand their biases and blind spots. This self-awareness is critical for managing egos impartially[7].  
- **Upward/Downward Management**: Modules on "managing sideways" and "managing upward" provide tactics for influencing stakeholders without formal authority—a key skill for tech leads navigating matrixed organizations[7].  
- **Judgment in Ambiguity**: Through case studies, students practice making decisions with incomplete data, which mirrors the challenges of tracking asynchronous team activities[7].

## Supplementary Recommendation:  
### **Negotiation and Leadership: Dealing with Difficult People and Problems**  
**Program Link**: [Negotiation and Leadership](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/courses-and-training/3-day/negotiation-and-leadership-dealing-with-difficult-people-and-problems-april-2025/)[13]  

While not part of Harvard Extension, this three-day intensive from Harvard’s Program on Negotiation complements the above courses. It includes role-play exercises on de-escalating conflicts with "difficult" colleagues and strategies for maintaining productivity under pressure[13].

## Implementation Strategy:  
1. **Prioritize MGMT E-4160 and MGMT E-4225** to build foundational skills in team dynamics and conflict resolution.  
2. **Enroll in the Leading More Effective Teams certificate** for accelerated, hands-on training in accountability frameworks.  
3. **Supplement with MGMT E-4152 or MGMT E-4100** to refine strategic leadership and self-management skills.  

Each course includes synchronous and asynchronous components, making them accessible for working professionals. For instance, MGMT E-4160’s live web conferences allow real-time interaction with instructors, while Negotiation and Organizational Conflict Resolution offers case-based exercises applicable to your tech team’s daily challenges[3][11]. By combining these programs, you’ll gain a holistic toolkit to lead with confidence, track progress effectively, and foster a collaborative team culture.
